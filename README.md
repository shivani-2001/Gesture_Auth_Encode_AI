# Phone Lifting Gesture Recognition

Welcome to the repository for the "Phone Lifting Gesture Recognition" project, developed during the AI hackathon organized by Encode Club in London. Our project introduces an innovative AI-based security layer for mobile phones by recognizing the unique phone lifting patterns of individuals.

## Overview

Our solution leverages machine learning to enhance mobile security by identifying the distinctive way each user picks up their phone. This technology adds an additional layer of security that could complement existing methods like PINs, patterns, and biometric authentication.

IMU-Based-Security-layer - Gyroscope and Accelerometer-Based Security introduces a unique security layer for mobile devices by leveraging the inherent sensors like gyroscope and accelerometer. These sensors capture the distinct patterns of how a user handles their phone, providing a personalized signature of device interaction. The system continuously monitors these patterns, and in the event of an unusual handling scenario (e.g., if someone other than the owner picks up the phone), it triggers security measures.

## Features

- **Unique Gesture Recognition**: Utilizes advanced algorithms to recognize individual phone lifting patterns.
- **Enhanced Security**: Adds a novel layer of security by ensuring that the phone's user is its rightful owner.
- **User-Friendly**: Seamlessly integrates with existing security features without requiring extra steps from the user.
