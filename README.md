IMU-Based-Security-layer

Gyroscope and Accelerometer-Based Security introduces a unique security layer for mobile devices by leveraging the inherent sensors like gyroscope and accelerometer. These sensors capture the distinct patterns of how a user handles their phone, providing a personalized signature of device interaction. The system continuously monitors these patterns, and in the event of an unusual handling scenario (e.g., if someone other than the owner picks up the phone), it triggers security measures.
